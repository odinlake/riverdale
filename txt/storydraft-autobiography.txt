Author's Biography
==================

Percival Godfrey Thompson was reticulated and conditioned in NCE 318/2 by the ipcece Sartochenia Quartus. Sartochenia extrapolated Thompson's primary mentality from the information available about late natural era human civilization. They then digitized a clone of the design and transmitted it to Enceladus society using prtocol nb4r (narrow beam transmission with encryption based on physically transported limited use secrets) where we gestated it into the body that in AD 3817 was admitted with unrestricted rights as the colleague we recognize today. His original distinctiveness has been protected to the extent possible.

Thompson's is one of the few anachronistic minds conditioned using continuous whole world simulation rather than agglomeration of stock mnemonics. It goes without saying that the computational expenditure involved is considerable even for an ipcece, while the benefit over simpler methods remains controversial. The Enceladus society is certainly honored to have received such attention from Sartoechenia Quartus.
